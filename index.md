## Background information

I graduated at the University of Bari, Italy (2002-2006) and obtained my PhD from the University of Padova, Italy (2007-2010) under the supervision of Victor Burenkov with a thesis on the _Spectral Stability of Second-Order Elliptic Operators Under Domain Perturbation_. Then I spent roughly five years (2010-2015) as a post-doc. at Padova and collaborated there with Victor Burenkov, Martino Bardi on PDEs arising from Differential Games and Optimal Control, and Franco Rampazzo on Geometric Control Theory and Nonsmooth Analysis. Then I spent a year (2016-2017) at Cardiff University, UK working with Federica Dragoni on systems of PDEs of Hörmander type arising from a particular class of Differential Games. From 2016, I am an Associate Professor at the University of Vlora, Albania. From 2017 I am Head of the Teaching and Research Group of Mathematical Analysis, Differential Equations and Geometry as well. Please see my CV for additional details.  


## Current Topics of Research:

- Iterated Lie brackets for non-smooth vector fields,
- Geometric Control Theory, sub-Riemannian Geometry, PDEs of Hörmander type,
- Mean Field Games,
- PDEs, mostly arising from optimal control and differential games,
- Stability estimates for solutions of elliptic boundary value problems under domain perturbation.
