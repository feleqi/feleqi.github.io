## Background information

I graduated from the University of Bari, Italy (2002--2006) and obtained my PhD from the University of Padova, Italy (2007--2010) under the supervision of Victor Burenkov with a thesis on the _Spectral Stability of Second-Order Elliptic Operators Under Domain Perturbation_. Then I spent roughly five years (2010--2015) as a post-doc. at Padova and collaborated there with Victor Burenkov, Martino Bardi and Pierpaolo Soravia on PDEs arising from Differential Games and Optimal Control, and Franco Rampazzo on Geometric Control Theory and Nonsmooth Analysis. Next, I spent a year (2016--2017) as a Research Associate at Cardiff University, UK working with Federica Dragoni on systems of PDEs of Hörmander type arising from a particular class of Differential Games and six months as Visiting Professor at KAUST, Saudi Arabia to work with Diogo Gomes and Teruo Tada on Hörmander MFGs as well. Since 2016, I am an Associate Professor at the University of Vlora, Albania. In addition, since 2017 I head the teaching and research Group of _Mathematical Analysis, Differential Equations and Geometry_ as well. Please see my CV for additional details.  


## Current Topics of Research:

- Iterated Lie brackets for non-smooth vector fields,
- Geometric Control Theory, sub-Riemannian Geometry, PDEs of Hörmander type,
- Mean Field Games,
- PDEs, mostly arising from optimal control and differential games,
- Stability estimates for solutions of elliptic boundary value problems under domain perturbation.
